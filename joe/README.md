This plot is to discover the relationship between languages used and the technical terms understanding. At first, all languages are showing in the plot. Users can then selcet sepcific languages to make a clear comparison.

Preprocessing:
I first select the columns containing language and tech terms. Then, I compute the ratio of people feeling comfortable explaining a tech term to a friend for different language. The code is in `preprocessing.ipynb` which can be opened by jupyter notebook. Notes that original csv file is not included in ths dir because of the size limitation. Please add the original csv to this dir before runing the code.
